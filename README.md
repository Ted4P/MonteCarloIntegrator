#Monte Carlo Integrator

##By Ted Pyne, Hyun Choi and Julia McClellan

###What is it?
This project is a single variate integrator, built in Java with a Swing GUI, using 4 types of Reimann sum to numerically approximate definite integrals using a random distribution of numbers. It includes a built-in lexer, parser and graphing functionality, all written in Java. It also includes an in development CLI multivariate integrator using similar principles.
